Plugin is aimed as a tool for casual QGIS users, which don't need to be familiar with Machine Learning.
The plugin packs all the complexity behind a simple UI, so that the user can easily process their data with the power of Deep Neural Networks.

Of course, the model needs to be first created by a user familiar with Machine Learning, according to model requirements.
Nevertheless, the entire complexity of processing is implemented in the plugin.
