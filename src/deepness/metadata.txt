about=
    Deepness plugin allows to easily perform segmentation, detection and regression on raster ortophotos with custom ONNX Neural Network models, bringing the power of deep learning to casual users.
    Features highlights:
     - processing any raster layer (custom ortophoto from file or layers from online providers, e.g Google Satellite)
     - limiting processing range to predefined area (visible part or area defined by vector layer polygons)
     - common types of models are supported: segmentation, regression, detection
     - integration with layers (both for input data and model output layers). Once an output layer is created, it can be saved as a file manually
     - model ZOO under development (planes detection on Bing Aerial, Corn field damage, Oil Storage tanks detection, cars detection, ...)
     - training data Export Tool - exporting raster and mask as small tiles
     - parametrization of the processing for advanced users (spatial resolution, overlap, postprocessing)
    Plugin requires external python packages to be installed. After the first plugin startup, a Dialog will show, to assist in this process. Please visit plugin the documentation for details.
